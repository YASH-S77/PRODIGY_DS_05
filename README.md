This is for PRODIGY INFOTECH Internship Task-05 (Data Science) 

🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis & Visualization – US Accidents Dataset
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify key patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Using exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques, the project uncovers accident trends, high-risk conditions, and geographic hotspots to better understand factors contributing to road accidents.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – US Accidents Dataset
Data Type: Large-scale traffic accident records across the United States
Key Attributes: Weather conditions, road features, time, location, and severity

🛠️ Key Steps Performed
Data loading and preprocessing
Handling missing and inconsistent values
Feature analysis based on weather, road conditions, and time of day
Temporal analysis (hourly, daily, and seasonal accident trends)
Geographic visualization of accident hotspots using maps
Identifying major contributing factors to accident severity

📈 Results & Insights
Accidents are more frequent during peak traffic hours
Certain weather conditions such as rain, fog, and snow show higher accident rates
Urban regions and highways emerge as major accident hotspots
Time of day and road features significantly influence accident occurrence and severity

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Folium / Geo-visualization libraries
Jupyter Notebook

🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to apply data analysis and visualization techniques to real-world traffic data in order to identify risk factors and accident-prone areas, supporting better road safety analysis and data-driven decision-making.
